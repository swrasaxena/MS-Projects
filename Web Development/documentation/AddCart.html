            <h3>Add Cart Page</h3>
            <br />
            <div class="align-text">
                On successful login, user will be navigated to this page which has a grid view of shopping items which user can add to his/her
                cart by mentioning the required quantity. User can also view the cart on clicking the "View Cart" button.
                <br />
                <br />
                Here I have used the table ShoppingItem which stores the following data to show in the grid view:
                <ul>
                    <li>Item ID</li>
                    <li>Item Name</li>
                    <li>Price</li>
                    <li>Image URL</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                Here Image URL is courtesy Google Images - I am storing external link of the images.
                <br />
                On clicking the "Add Items" button, if the item is present in the table against that user then the quantity would get updated with the new quantity.
                If not, then it gets added to the table. For this purpose, I am storing data in a separate table called "Cart" which has the following fields:
                <ul>
                    <li>Item ID</li>
                    <li>User ID</li>
                    <li>Quantity</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                On successfully adding the items, user would be shown a success message "Items added/updated successfully to the Cart." otherwise
                an error message would be shown as "Items not added to the Cart, please try again later.".
                <br />
                <br />
                As part of validations, I have Null Reference, Invalid Item ID or Quantity checks and the insert/update to database will not happen under these circumstances.
