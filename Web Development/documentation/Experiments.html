            <h3>Experiments Used in Project</h3>
            <br />
            <div class="align-text">
                While I have done a plethora of topics via my experiments throughout this course, I would like to mention some experiments that I have used in
                my project pages:
                <br />
                <br />
                1. Google Translator - I did an experiment to see how google translator can be integrated on a website. I have integrated this on the top menubar of my
                project pages
                <br />
                <br />
                2. Bootstrap Sticky Header - My project's top navigation bar is a sticky header. I did an experiment on the same to see how one could use Bootstrap's
                navbar.
                <br />
                <br />
                3. JSONP Football League - I did an experiment to explore ESPN API and had displayed the team data in a tabular format using javascript. My project's
                teams page is the same.
                <br />
                <br />
                4. General News - I did an experiment on retrieving Harry Potter books from Google Books API and displaying the details using jQuery UI's accordion.
                My project has a General News tab of Football Now page which uses the same concept and same kind of details.
                <br />
                <br />
                5. Audio and Video - I did an experiment to check out HTML5's audio and video tags. I have used the same in my project. My home page has the background music
                which plays via audio tag and video that pops up in Videos page.
                <br />
                <br />
                6. Bootstrap Columns - Throughout my project, I have made use of bootstrap columns for extra small devices which helps to achieve responsive behavior.
                <br />
                <br />
                7. Login, Feedback and Google Maps - I did experiments on each of these which are all part of my project.
                <br />
                <br />
                8. Database Updates, Display - I have used experiments on showing data via data lists, grid views and updates to database as part of my shopping cart module.
                <br />
                <br />
                9. RSS Feed - I had done an experiment to see how one can parse RSS feeds using ASP's XMLDataSource and have used that on my Football Now page to display team news.
