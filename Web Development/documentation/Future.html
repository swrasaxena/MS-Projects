            <h3>Future Scope</h3>
            <br />
            <div class="align-text">
                There is always a scope for improvement and mine is no exception. Here is a list of improvements which I would
                continue to work on and integrate the same as and when I complete them:
                <br />
                <br />
                1. Player Information - My API restricts users from displaying player information for all players in NFL. I had explored many APIs - Yahoo QL (YQL),
                CBSSports, Sports Data API, Fantasy Sports API, NFL.com API to name a few but these required extra layer of authentication and limited
                calls alongwith pricing. So I would continue to explore on this front and try to get data for all players of NFL.
                <br />
                <br />
                2. Youtube videos - I would love to integrate youtube videos on NFL to my project.
                <br />
                <br />
                3. Team News - As I faced many challenges in parsing RSS Feed for each of the 32 team's news using XMLDataSource or Google Feed API, I
                would continue to explore this domain and try to incorporate each team's news.
                <br />
                <br />
                4. Scores - One can also integrate scores and stats for past NFL Season. I would continue to explore an API for this, if not I can always
                store data in database and create my own web service to extract data and display it.
