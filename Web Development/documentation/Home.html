            <h3>Home Page Design</h3>
            <br />
            <div class="align-text">
                My home page has mainly two components:
                <br />
                <br />
                1. <u>Responsive Image Slider</u> - I have taken this image slider from Pixedelic.com which has a camera basic slider
                with all random image slide effects. I have used static images as part of this slider since my API did not have much
                images and other reason being I could tailor the images as per my need.
                <br />
                Images courtesy - <a href="http://www.pixedelic.com/plugins/camera/" target="_blank">Google</a>
                 and <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL.com</a>
                <br />
                <br />
                2. <u>Audio</u> - I have used HTML5's &lt;audio tag&gt; to play NFL's theme song. I have 
                included the audio controls to play or pause it as and when needed.
