                I have used ASP's Login control for logging into my online shopping site for purchasing football merchandise.
                ASP's login control is a powerful feature which provides inbuilt validations and does not allow user to log in unless
                user has entered proper credentials.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have used session state feature of ASP to get the user in session required for further pages on successful login.
                On successful login, user will be directed to Add Cart page which allows user to add items to their cart. Also, the Login link
                on top of the menu bar will not be visible. This design decision was taken to prevent multiple sessions. A logged in
                user will necessarily need to log out and only then a new session would begin.
