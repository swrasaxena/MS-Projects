            <br />
            <div class="align-text">
                My master page is rather simple which has the top navigation bar and a footer. I have used bootstrap throught my project pages so the css and javascript files
                have been included in master page. I also wanted to integrate Google Language translator and hence the same is present as part of my top-navigation bar.
                <br />
                One more thing that I had to include in my master page was Paypal button to integrate with Paypal. This decision was taken because ASP.Net does not
                support form within another form. The code for Paypal button is a form. By default, this Paypal button would be hidden and would be visible on view cart page
                where I have put a notice on payment method.
