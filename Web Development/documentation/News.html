                I have used Bootstrap's Tab feature which is very powerful to divide news into 2 sections:
                <br />
                <br />
                1. <u>General News tab</u> - Here I am retrieving data from ESPN's News and Headlines API with headlines, short description, 
                external link to entire news article and respective images using javascript and jQuery's ajax() function. I am displaying this
                data in the form of accordion using jQuery UI's accordion which is a very powerful feature.
                <br />
                <br />
                2. <u>NFL Season 2013 Top 2 Team's News tab</u> - 
                This was the most challenging section where I intended to display each of the 32 team's news by allowing the user to select
                from a given drop down. I was unable to achieve this as the RSS Feed that I found was google news feed which took team name
                as the query parameter. This was not getting parsed using simple ASP's XMLDataSource feature. Then I came across Google Feed API
                which uses google.setOnLoadCallback() function which is a very restrictive function as it gets called automatically on
                document load. I tried to make do without this function and also on button click call this function but alas! it did not work.
                Hence I decided to use this to display just one team's news and for the other one I am using XMLDataSource to parse the RSS Feed.
                The two teams are the top 2 of NFL Season 2013 - 2014 i.e. Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos.
