                Welcome to Football Mania! You guessed it right... Football is the hot topic of my project.
                My project deals with National Football League (NFL) - its current happenings and past season that went by i.e.
                Season 2013 - 2014. It gives the news on draft for season 2014 - 2015 as well. One can view details of each team
                of NFL as well as latest happenings related to the teams and its players. I have also implemented an online
                shopping cart where a logged in user can purchase football merchandise. I have integrated this cool facility with
                Paypal so user would be directed to Paypal for payment. Due to security reasons, the user would be asked for login credentials
                to make payment at Paypal.
                <br />
                I have used ESPN API and Google Feed API to retrieve real time data on NFL.
                <br />
