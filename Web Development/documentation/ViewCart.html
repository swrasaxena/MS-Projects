            <h3>View Cart Page</h3>
            <br />
            <div class="align-text">
                The View Cart page allows user to view his/her cart items with total price for each item and sum total calculated dynamically and displayed on the page.
                User has the option of deleting multiple items from his/her cart by selecting the checkboxes against each item
                and clicking "Delete from Cart" button. A confirmation popup would be displayed asking the user to confirm deletion.
                If confirmed, the item would be deleted from the Cart table and from his cart list.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also wanted to include "Update" feature here but normal grid view update was causing an issue that the individual total price
                field was becoming blank on update. I tried to resolve this issue but alas! could not. Hence I added a link to go back to the
                "Add Cart" page and user can then edit the quantity there on click of "Add Items" button.
                <br />
                <br />
                If the user is fine with the cart, then user can proceed to payment gateway using Paypal Buy Now option provided.
                As I mentioned earlier, this part of code is a form and ASP does not support form within another, hence the Paypal button
                is shown after my footer via CSS. I tried to bring it up but cannot as it is a form outside of my main form.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also added a check that if the logged in user is not in session then user cannot see the cart or any of the buttons on both pages - 
                Add Cart and View Cart.
                <br />
                <br />
                Below is a screenshot of how the cart looks:
